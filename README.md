**GOAL:**

This small project aims to periodically take screenshots from the runescape game and analyze if you are in combat. If
you start combat it will note down the time it takes you to kill whatever you are killing. This would be saved to a log
file and could be expanded to calculate kills per hour and profit per hour.

**TODO:**

- Get screenshots from specific part of the screen
- Analyze for enemy name (?) and health left (?)
- Alternatively just look for the colors inside the healthbar
- Make a log class
- Make a monster class
- Add docstrings to Duration class
- Add check function to test if values are valid for Duration class
